# Business Site

The assignment were to create a business site that involve a form, an accordion and a image or video header. 

## The problem

I first started out creating a grid, because I was curious about how to make a grid and what features it has. I also wanted to make an "easy" sedign so i could fokus on the weeks more difficult tasks, like how so make an video header with a text overlay. I was determend to make the video header work, even if I wanted to just give in and make a image header instead for some short moments. Im grateful for finding a great explanation on stack overflow that helped me to make it work.
