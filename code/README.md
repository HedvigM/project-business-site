# Business Site

The assignment were to create a business site that involve a form, an accordion and a image or video header. 

## The problem

I first started out creating a grid, because i didnt make a grid the last week. I wanted to make an "easy" sedign so i could fokus on the weeks more difficult tasks. I was determend to have a video as an header, even if that was a more difficult task than to make a header with an image. And then i wanted the text to appear in center,over the video. This was something i struggled with, but after finding a wery good explanation on stack overflow, i managed to make it work. 

If i had more time i would like to have incorporated som animations.
